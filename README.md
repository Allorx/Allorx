### Hi there 👋

<!--
**Allorx/Allorx** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Alex (Aleksas)

- 🔭 Here you can find open-source projects and physics papers that I wrote while studying at Royal Holloway University (graduating May 2021); I also make small projects here to learn new things or push boundaries - I believe the best way to learn is by practical experience.

- ❤️ Current work: I am the director of a small indie game dev team, Misty Blue Tech Ltd; we make games on the side. Check it out: https://www.mistyblue.tech/
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me directly by email - aleksas@mistyblue.tech
- 🎁 Fun Fact: The moon has moonquakes - https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/goddard/2019/moonquakes
